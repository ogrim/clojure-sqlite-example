# clojure-sqlite-example

Just a small, simple example for basic SQLite usage

## Usage

run lein deps and look at core.clj, evaluate the expressions and the sqlite database will apear in the db folder. You can use an external tool to view or edit the content, and try out fun stuff in the REPL.

You can also run `lein run` from the command line or create an independent jar with `lein ueberjar`.
